Q1.What is Inheritance in Java?
=  The technique of creating a new class by using an existing class functionality is called inheritance in Java. In other words, inheritance is a process where a child class acquires all the properties and
    behaviors of the parent class.
    
Q2.What is Is-A relationship in Java?
= Is-A relationship represents Inheritance. It is implemented using the “extends” keyword. It is used for code reusability.

Q3.What is super class and subclass?
=  A class from where a subclass inherits features is called superclass. It is also called base class or parent class.
     A class that inherits all the members (fields, method, and nested classes) from other class is called subclass. 
      It is also called a derived class, child class, or extended class.
      
Q4.How is Inheritance implemented/achieved in Java?
=Inheritance can be implemented or achieved by using two keywords:
  extends: extends is a keyword that is used for developing the inheritance between two classes and two interfaces.
  implements: implements keyword is used for developing the inheritance between a class and interface.
  
Q5.Which class in Java is superclass of every other class?
=  In Java, Object class is the superclass of every other class.

Q6.Can a class extend itself?
= No, a class cannot extend itself.

Q7.Can we assign superclass to subclass?
=No.

Q8.Can a class extend more than one class?
= No, one class can extend only a single class.

Q9. Are constructor and instance initialization block inherited to subclass?
= No, constructor and instance initialization block of the superclass cannot be inherited to its subclass but they are executed while
    creating an object of the subclass.
    
Q10.Which keyword do you use to define a subclass?
=extends keyword.

Q11.What is Hybrid inheritance in java? How will you achieve it?
=A hybrid inheritance in java is a combination of single and multiple inheritance. It can be achieved through interfaces.
