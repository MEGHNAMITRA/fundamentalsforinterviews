Q1. What is IdentityHashMap?
= IdentityHashMap is a class that implements Serializable, Clonable interfaces, Map, and extends AbstractMap class. It is designed for the case wherein there is a need of reference-equality semantics.

Q2.What is WeakHashMap?
= WeakHashMap is an implementation of the Java Map. It is used to store weak references to its keys. Sorting using this Map allows a key-value pair is collected as garbage. Its key is not referenced outside WeakHashMap.

Q3.What are the methods to make collection thread-safe?
= The methods to make collection thread safe are:
   Collections.synchronizedList(list);
   Collections.synchronizedMap(map);
   Collections.synchronizedSet(set);
   
Q4.Explain UnsupportedOperationException
= UnsupportedOperationException is an exception whch is thrown on methods that are not supported by actual collection type.
  For example, Developer is making a read-only list using “Collections.unmodifiableList(list)” and calling call(), add() or remove() method. It should clearly throw UnsupportedOperationException.
  
Q5.Name the collection classes that gives random element access to its elements
= Collection classes that give random element access to its elements are: 1) ArrayList, 2) HashMap, 3) TreeMap, and 4) Hashtable.

Q6.Mention the implementing List and Set interface
= Class implementing List interface: 1) ArrayList, 2) Vector, and 3) LinkedList.   Class implementing Set interface: 1) HashSet, and 2) TreeSet.

Q7.Explain the design pattern followed by Iterator
= The iterator follows the detail of the iterator design pattern. It provides developer to navigate through the objects collections using a common interface without knowing its implementation.

Q8.What is the peek() of the Queue interface?
= Peek () is a method of queue interface. It retrieves all the elements but does not remove the queue head. In case if the Queue is empty, then this method will return null.

Q9.What is CopyOnWriteArrayList?
= CopyOnWriteArrayList is a variant of ArrayList in which operations like add and set are implemented by creating a copy of the array. It is a thread-safe, and thereby it does not throw ConcurrentModificationException. This ArrayLists permits all the elements, including null.

Q10.Explain Linked HashSet
= Java LinkedHashSet class is a Linked list and Hash table implementation of the Set interface. It contains unique elements same as a HashSet. Linked HashSet in Java also provides optional set operations that can maintain the order of insertion.
